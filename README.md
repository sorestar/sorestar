## Hello (៸៸¯ᗜ¯៸៸)
✶Languages: Python, C/C#/C++, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS
✶Tools: Unity, Aseprite (Pixel art animation), Blender, Android Studio, Visual Script Code, Firebase, OpenAPI

I'm Iris, an aspiring game developer / software engineer studying Mathematics in USA. 

I make as much stuff as the languages I speak, and I commit fast.

My favorite project by far is a dining application specified for the highschool that I had attended.

✶My current project is developing a 3D Quest-based RPG game!

I always try my best to customize everything, but I'm still soaking up all the knowledge.

Thank you for passing by 🏠
