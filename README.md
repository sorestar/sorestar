## Hello (៸៸¯ᗜ¯៸៸)

I'm Iris, an aspiring game developer / software engineer studying Mathematics in USA. 

I make as much stuff as the languages I speak, and I commit fast.

My favorite project by far is a dining application specified for the highschool that I had attended.

I always try my best to customize everything, but I'm still soaking up all the knowledge.

Thank you for passing by my home 🏠
